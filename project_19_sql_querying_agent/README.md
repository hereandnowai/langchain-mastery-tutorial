# Project 19: SQL Querying Agent

**Objective:** To build a SQL querying agent that can answer questions about a database.

**`main.py`:**
*   Connect to a `sample.db`.
*   Use `create_sql_query_chain` to generate and execute SQL queries.

**`sample.db`:** A simple SQLite database with a few tables.

**`README.md`:** Explain how to use LangChain to interact with SQL databases.

**Real-World Value:** This project demonstrates how to build a natural language interface to a SQL database. This is useful for business intelligence, data analysis, and more.
