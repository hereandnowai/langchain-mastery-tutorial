# Project 9: Question Answering Agent

## Objective
Create a more advanced Q&A agent that can answer general knowledge questions by leveraging an external tool like Wikipedia.

## Setup and Run
1.  Navigate to the `project_09_question_answering_agent` directory:
    ```bash
    cd project_09_question_answering_agent
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The agent will use the Wikipedia tool to answer the questions.

## Real-World Value
This project demonstrates how LangChain agents can integrate with and utilize external knowledge sources to answer a wide range of general knowledge questions. This is a fundamental capability for building intelligent assistants, sophisticated search interfaces, or educational tools that can provide accurate and up-to-date information. By connecting to external APIs and databases, LLMs can overcome their inherent knowledge limitations and provide more comprehensive and reliable answers.
