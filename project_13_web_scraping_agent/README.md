# Project 13: Web Scraping Agent

## Objective
Create an agent that can scrape content from a given URL and answer questions based on it.

## Setup and Run
1.  Navigate to the `project_13_web_scraping_agent` directory:
    ```bash
    cd project_13_web_scraping_agent
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The agent will scrape a sample URL and answer a question about its content.

## Real-World Value
Web scraping is a powerful technique for gathering information from the internet. This project demonstrates how LangChain agents can be equipped with web scraping capabilities, allowing them to extract data from websites and use it to answer questions or perform analysis. This is invaluable for competitive analysis, market research, content aggregation, news monitoring, and building custom datasets from publicly available web pages.
