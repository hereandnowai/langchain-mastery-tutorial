# Project 10: Summarization Pipeline

## Objective
Summarize a given piece of text, demonstrating a simple text processing pipeline.

## Setup and Run
1.  Navigate to the `project_10_summarization_pipeline` directory:
    ```bash
    cd project_10_summarization_pipeline
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The script will print the summarized text.

## Real-World Value
This project reiterates the concept of text summarization, framing it as a basic pipeline. While simple, it illustrates how multiple steps (e.g., loading text, applying a prompt, generating output) can be chained together to form a complete process. This is fundamental for more complex applications where data flows through several LLM-powered stages, such as document processing workflows, content curation, or automated report generation.
