# Project 2: Simple Chatbot

## Objective
Create a basic interactive chatbot that continuously takes user input, feeds it to an LLM, and prints the LLM's response.

## Setup and Run
1.  Navigate to the `project_02_simple_chatbot` directory:
    ```bash
    cd project_02_simple_chatbot
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4.  Type your messages and press Enter. Type `quit` to exit the chatbot.

## Real-World Value
This project demonstrates the fundamental building blocks of an interactive AI assistant or customer service bot. By continuously taking user input and generating responses, it lays the groundwork for applications that can engage in dynamic conversations, providing information, support, or entertainment.
