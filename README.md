**designed with passion for innovation**

Welcome to the "LangChain from Scratch to Mastery" tutorial! This comprehensive guide is designed to take you from the basics of Large Language Models (LLMs) and LangChain to building sophisticated, real-world AI applications.

## Why LangChain?

LangChain is a powerful framework for developing applications powered by language models. It simplifies the process of building complex LLM workflows, enabling you to chain together different components, integrate with external data sources, and create intelligent agents. Whether you're looking to build chatbots, Q&A systems, data analysis tools, or more, LangChain provides the tools you need to bring your ideas to life.

## How to Use This Tutorial

This tutorial is structured as a series of 20 incremental projects, each building upon the concepts learned in the previous one. To get started, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/langchain-mastery-tutorial.git
    cd langchain-mastery-tutorial
    ```

2.  **Set up Virtual Environment with `uv`:**
    We recommend using `uv` for fast and efficient dependency management.
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uv venv
    source .uv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .uv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Navigate to Each Project:**
    Each project resides in its own directory (e.g., `project_01_hello_langchain`). Navigate into the project directory to run its code.

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Inside each project directory, install the specific dependencies listed in its `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Run the Project:**
    Execute the `main.py` file for each project:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
