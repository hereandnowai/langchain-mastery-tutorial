# Project 20: Basic LangGraph Agent

**Objective:** To introduce the concept of building cyclical and stateful applications with LangGraph.

**`main.py`:**
*   Define a simple graph with a couple of nodes.
*   The graph should take an initial state and transition between nodes based on some logic.

**`README.md`:** Provide a high-level overview of LangGraph and its benefits for creating more complex and robust agents.

**Real-World Value:** LangGraph is a powerful tool for building complex, stateful, and cyclical applications with LLMs. This is useful for building agents that can reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks.
