# Project 14: Finance Agent - Company Info

## Objective
Create a finance agent that can retrieve basic company information using a simulated tool.

## Setup and Run
1.  Navigate to the `project_14_finance_agent_company_info` directory:
    ```bash
    cd project_14_finance_agent_company_info
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The agent will use its tool to provide information about a company.

## Real-World Value
Building on the agent concept, this project demonstrates how an LLM can act as a specialized finance agent capable of fetching company-specific data. While this example uses a simulated tool, in a real application, it would connect to financial databases or APIs (e.g., Bloomberg, Refinitiv, or public company filings). This enables automated research, due diligence, and quick access to critical business information, which is invaluable for investors, financial analysts, and business development professionals.
