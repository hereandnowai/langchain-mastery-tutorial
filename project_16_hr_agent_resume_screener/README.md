Screen a sample resume against a set of job requirements and provide a summary.

## Setup and Run
1.  Navigate to the `project_16_hr_agent_resume_screener` directory:

## Real-World Value
Automating resume screening is a significant application of LLMs in Human Resources. This project demonstrates how an HR agent can quickly evaluate a candidate's resume against specific job requirements, highlighting relevant skills and experience or identifying gaps. This can drastically reduce the manual effort involved in the initial stages of recruitment, allowing HR professionals to focus on more strategic tasks and improving the efficiency of the hiring process. It helps in quickly shortlisting candidates that best fit the criteria.
