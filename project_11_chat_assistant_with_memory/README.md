# Project 11: Chat Assistant with Memory

## Objective
Create a chat assistant that can remember past conversations, enabling more coherent and natural interactions.

## Setup and Run
1.  Navigate to the `project_11_chat_assistant_with_memory` directory:
    ```bash
    cd project_11_chat_assistant_with_memory
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The script will demonstrate a short conversation where the chatbot remembers previous turns.

## Real-World Value
Memory is a critical component for building truly interactive and personalized AI assistants. Without memory, chatbots treat each user query as a new, isolated request, leading to disjointed and frustrating conversations. By incorporating memory, as demonstrated in this project, chatbots can maintain context, refer to previous statements, and provide more relevant and helpful responses. This is essential for applications like personalized customer support, interactive learning platforms, and long-running conversational agents.
