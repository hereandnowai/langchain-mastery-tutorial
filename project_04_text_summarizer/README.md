# Project 4: Text Summarizer

## Objective
Summarize a given piece of text using a LangChain prompt template and LLMChain.

## Setup and Run
1.  Navigate to the `project_04_text_summarizer` directory:
    ```bash
    cd project_04_text_summarizer
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The script will print the summarized text.

## Real-World Value
Text summarization is a crucial application of LLMs. This project demonstrates how to build a basic summarizer that can condense long articles, emails, reports, or any textual content into concise summaries. This is invaluable for quickly grasping the main points of lengthy documents, improving information consumption, and automating content creation workflows.
