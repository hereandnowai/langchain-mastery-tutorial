# Project 8: Simple Data Retrieval Agent

## Objective
Create a basic agent that can retrieve data from a predefined list of facts.

## Setup and Run
1.  Navigate to the `project_08_simple_data_retrieval_agent` directory:
    ```bash
    cd project_08_simple_data_retrieval_agent
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The agent will use its tool to answer questions based on the predefined facts.

## Real-World Value
This project demonstrates how agents can be equipped with tools to retrieve information from structured data sources. In a real-world scenario, this could be a database, an API, or a knowledge graph. This capability is crucial for building intelligent systems that can answer specific queries by accessing and interpreting factual information. Examples include internal knowledge bases for employees, product catalogs for e-commerce, or customer information systems for support agents.
