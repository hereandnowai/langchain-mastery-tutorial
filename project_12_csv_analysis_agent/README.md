# Project 12: CSV Analysis Agent

## Objective
Create an agent that can analyze and answer questions based on the data in a CSV file.

## Setup and Run
1.  Navigate to the `project_12_csv_analysis_agent` directory:
    ```bash
    cd project_12_csv_analysis_agent
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The agent will process the `sample_data.csv` and answer the predefined questions.

## Real-World Value
This project demonstrates a powerful application of LLM agents: data analysis. By enabling an agent to interact with structured data like CSV files, you can automate tasks such as data summarization, trend identification, and answering specific queries about datasets. This is incredibly useful for business intelligence, financial analysis, scientific research, and any field that deals with large volumes of tabular data, allowing users to get insights without writing complex code.
