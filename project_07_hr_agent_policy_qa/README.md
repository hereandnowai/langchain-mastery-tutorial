# Project 7: HR Agent - Policy Q&A

## Objective
Answer questions about a simple HR policy document (`hr_policy.txt`).

## Setup and Run
1.  Navigate to the `project_07_hr_agent_policy_qa` directory:
    ```bash
    cd project_07_hr_agent_policy_qa
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The script will answer a question about the HR policy.

## Real-World Value
This project reinforces the concept of Q&A over documents, applying it to a practical business scenario: an HR policy. Building an HR agent that can answer employee questions about company policies (e.g., vacation days, sick leave, benefits) can significantly reduce the workload on HR departments, provide instant answers to employees, and improve overall employee satisfaction. This is a foundational step towards creating intelligent internal knowledge bases.
